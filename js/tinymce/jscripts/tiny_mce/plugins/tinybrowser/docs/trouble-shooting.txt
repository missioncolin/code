Troubleshooting
===============

If you receive a 403, 406 or 412 status error on uploading files, please create
an .htaccess file in your tinybrowser directory with the following contents:

SecFilterEngine Off
SecFilterScanPOST Off

If you use Linux and the Squid proxy, you need to add a "ignore_expect_100 on"
flag to the squid config file to avoid a 417 status error.

If you use HTTP authentication, then uploading via the Flash component will
cause issues. As a workaround, place an .htaccess file in your tinybrowser
directory with the following contents:

<Files upload_file.php>
Order Allow,Deny
Allow from all
Satisfy any
</Files>

Note on the above - this effectively removes the HTTP authentication for the
upload_file.php file!
